  Requires the registered grilling skill and access to
  the workstream's available conversation, repository, issue, pull-request, and
  CI evidence. Selected tickets also require create-issue and access to the Git
  hosting service; selected immediate deliveries require deliver. Timing
  ledger analysis uses Python 3 when available telemetry calls for it.

# Run retrospective

Assess the completed workstream through delivery-speed, process, and
codebase-health lenses and agree evidence-backed improvements with the user.
The actual `grilling` skill owns the decision loop. Present the retrospective
in the conversation.

## Authorization

The request to run a retrospective authorizes analysis only. File edits and
other mutations require the user's final selection through `grilling`, and
that selection authorizes only the selected documentation edits, the selected
ticket actions through `create-issue`, and invocation of any explicitly
selected immediate implementation through its normal `/deliver` workflow,
never direct implementation by this skill. It does not authorize unrelated
commits, pushes, PRs, issues, or file edits. The original request to run a
retrospective is not this final selection.

## Gates

- Define the workstream boundary from the current conversation, handoff, diffs,
  commits, issues, PRs, reviews, checks, outcomes, and rework. Record unavailable
  evidence and lower confidence; do not invent a narrative or broaden into a
  repository audit.
- Before proposing a process or design correction, trace its originating
  decision, the current implementation or executable configuration, and the
  current documentation. Distinguish missing design from implementation drift
  and documentation drift. Preserve a settled choice unless contradictory
  current evidence requires a new decision; do not re-grill it merely because
  the implementation or prose drifted.
- Inspect the complete available coordinator and subagent record, including
  process events and handoffs. Identify repeated reasoning, rebuilt or dropped
  evidence, loaded-but-unused or bypassed skills, manual resumes,
  capability-routing mistakes, and other context consumption that added no
  value. Report this no-value context separately from other findings and name
  any unavailable conversation or process evidence.
- Read [references/timing-analysis.md](references/timing-analysis.md) before
  building the timing ledger. For a completed Milestone Rush, also read its
  ignored `.agent/milestone-rush-events.jsonl` under that reference. Reconcile
  telemetry with current repository, issue, pull-request, and CI evidence;
  partial or missing telemetry is a confidence limitation, not permission to
  infer values.
- Invoke `grilling` with the evidence and candidates. Do not imitate it with
  ad-hoc questions; stop if it is unavailable. Let it ask one decision at a time
  with a recommendation. Act only after it reaches shared understanding and
  confirms the exact action set.
- Assess all three lenses, even when one produces no durable finding:
  - **Delivery speed:** less waiting, rework, handoff friction, unnecessary
    scope, or cognitive load without weakening quality.
  - **Process:** planning, decisions, handoffs, gates, tools, and collaboration.
  - **Codebase:** architecture, maintainability, tests, developer experience,
    reliability, and accumulated friction.
- Promote only generalized, project-level lessons supported by evidence. Exclude
  chronology, one-off mistakes, personal preferences, duplicates, existing
  rules, and speculation.
- Apply de-duplication to the workstream: reuse prior investigations and
  decisions, coalesce the same event from multiple evidence systems, and combine
  candidate lessons with the same cause and action while retaining provenance.
  Report repeated implementation or discoverability evidence when it caused
  workstream friction, but do not turn the retro into a repository-wide
  duplication or discoverability audit; that belongs to `codebase-audit`.

## Route each lesson

- **Documentation edit:** durable guidance in existing contracts, READMEs,
  `docs/`, ADRs, AGENTS, skills, templates, policies, or contributor guidance.
  Prefer tightening or coupling with existing text. Direct edits are limited to
  documentation.
- **Follow-up ticket:** source, executable configuration, or other implementation
  is needed. Offer more detail, further grilling, `create-issue` (with a draft
  first if the user wants one), or skip; the delegated workflow retains its own
  gates.
- **Implement before next cycle:** recommend this route when a selected
  improvement should be delivered before another cycle begins. Recommendation
  alone authorizes nothing. After explicit user selection, reuse or create its
  visibility issue through `create-issue`, enter the normal `/deliver`
  workflow, and keep this retrospective active until the action is delivered or
  genuinely blocked. The delegated workflows retain all of their gates.
- **Report only:** useful evidence warrants neither an edit nor a ticket.

Use both edit and ticket only when the guidance and its implementation are
separately necessary. A missing document may be created only when the user
selects its exact proposed contents.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the workstream boundary and read relevant project documentation.
2. Trace origins and the coordinator/subagent record under the gates above.
   Then build an evidence ledger of outcomes, friction, rework, surprises,
   effective or missed gates, successful practices, and separately classified
   no-value context under all three lenses. Select one or more timing profiles
   from the timing reference and map both high-level lifecycle phases and
   available ground-level operations.
3. Reconstruct exclusive critical-path contribution, overlapping or masked
   work, and aggregate resource consumption without double-counting. Rank
   bottlenecks by exclusive wall-clock impact; report confidence and missing
   attribution.
4. Remove unsupported, session-specific, duplicate, and already-covered
   candidates; classify the rest using the routes above.
5. Summarize key delivered changes and material outcomes in conversation with
   evidence-backed Before and After states, uncertainty, and source links. Use
   a diagram or comparison table when it clarifies a mechanism or decision.
6. Run `grilling` one decision at a time with the boundary, evidence, current
   docs, absences, and candidates. Offer to deep-dive into any finding before
   selecting actions; incorporate new evidence into the comparison.
7. Present the detailed summary:
   - findings under every lens, including no-finding results;
   - lifecycle and selected surface profiles, exclusive critical-path ranking,
     masked or overlapping work, ground-level build/test/tool timings, aggregate
     resource totals, evidence provenance, and confidence gaps;
   - key outcomes, Before/After states, and available deep dives;
   - exact proposed documentation additions, replacements, or removals by file;
   - concise ticket summaries with all available action paths;
   - report-only observations, supporting evidence, confidence, and gaps.
8. Obtain exact user selections through `grilling`. More detail or further
   grilling returns to that loop and regenerates the summary.
9. Apply only the selected actions under the authorization above, preserving
   documentation structure and avoiding duplication. For each selected
   implement-before-next-cycle action, reuse or create the visibility issue,
   invoke normal `/deliver`, and remain in the retrospective until it is
   delivered or genuinely blocked.
10. Compare the result with the confirmed action set and run declared
    documentation checks.
11. Report changed docs, created issue links, immediate-action
    delivery or blocker evidence, report-only findings, confidence limits, and
    observed validation. Keep workstream history in chat and remind the user
    they can request a deep dive into any finding.
