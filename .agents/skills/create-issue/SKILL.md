# Create issue

Turn the user's input into an implementation-ready issue grounded in the current
repository, then create it. A request to file an issue authorizes creating it
once the gates below pass.

Reuse authorization and settled decisions within their scope across turns.
Before a required pause, complete independent authorized work, then link the
exact skill file as a Markdown link and quote the rule requiring a new decision
or authority verbatim in a block quote.

## Gates

- Investigate before drafting: read the applicable project instructions and
  vision, search open and closed issues for duplicates of the outcome as well
  as the mechanism, and inspect the affected code, tests, and docs.
- For material unresolved requirements or a requested interview, use the actual
  registered `grill-with-docs` or `grill-me` loop; prefer `grill-with-docs`.
  Reuse settled decisions. If neither is available, investigate directly and
  ask only for missing facts that affect the issue.
- Stop before drafting when the request conflicts with project vision, is a
  duplicate, or needs material facts that cannot be established. For a
  duplicate, return the existing issue and stop without asking whether to file
  the same request anyway or mutate the existing issue.
- Before posting, resolve the authenticated GitHub username and exact model name
  from the current GitHub account and agent environment. Stop if either is
  unavailable; never guess or substitute a generic label.

## Draft review

Choose the template, title, labels, and body from project evidence and create
the issue without draft approval. Show the draft for approval first only when
the user asks for it, for example with `/create-issue draft` or "show me the
draft first", including in a later turn; that request lasts for its stated
scope. `automatic` is accepted and changes nothing. Resolve a material
ambiguity by asking about that point under the gates above, not by falling back
to a full draft review.

## Workflow

1. Discover the repository's issue templates and existing label conventions.
2. Investigate the request and resolve any remaining material question using
   the gates above. Ground any progress claim in evidence gathered this run.
3. Draft against the matching template. Keep only decision-, implementation-,
   and verification-relevant content:
   - a specific plain-language title;
   - problem, current and expected behavior, scope, constraints, and required
     behavior;
   - reproduction and regression expectations for bugs;
   - user/test impact, likely affected area, and related work where relevant.
4. For UI/UX work or local screenshots and videos, read
   [references/ui-evidence.md](references/ui-evidence.md); never commit
   evidence media to the repository. Put non-media evidence such as probe
   output inside a collapsed `<details>` block.
5. Choose only existing labels unless the user asks to create one.
6. When a draft review request still applies and that exact draft is not yet
   approved,
   show the proposed title, labels, and body, ask the user to approve or revise
   it, and stop; create the issue only after approval.
7. End the issue body with this visually separate GitHub Note, replacing both
   values with the exact identities resolved for this run:

   > [!NOTE]
   > Created on behalf of @username using ModelName.

8. Create the issue with the available GitHub tooling, verify the returned
   issue's repository and intended content, and return its URL. If the write
   response is lost or interrupted, search for the issue before retrying.
   Report an unresolved write as uncertain; a request being accepted or
   delegated is not proof that the issue was created.

Lead with the outcome. Omit boilerplate, repeated summaries, and a narration of
the workflow.
