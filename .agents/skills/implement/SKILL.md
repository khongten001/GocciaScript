# Implement

Develop the smallest complete change that satisfies the agreed requirements.
Reuse settled scope, approach and authorization. A failed check, diagnosis or
available fix does not end implementation. Only a material unresolved
decision, new authority or an external blocker after safe alternatives are
exhausted can stop dependent work; complete independent work before asking. If
a skill requires a pause, link its loaded file as a Markdown link and quote the
rule verbatim in a block quote; a paraphrase or a bare path does not let the
user check the rule.

## Establish the work

Infer the target from the request, conversation, handoff and repository; no
issue/idea selector is required. Verify an identified issue's repository,
requirements, comments, readiness and current state. A failed lookup does not
make it an unfiled idea. For a described outcome, search for matching work and
reuse its decisions. Otherwise establish a concise mini-spec with the outcome,
scope, constraints and testable success measures; do not file an issue merely
to implement it. Resolve conflicting or ambiguous targets before editing.

Read project instructions, relevant code, tests and durable decisions. Use the
nearest Definitions of Ready and Done; if absent after a real search, use the
workflow's checks and declared project commands and record the acceptance gap.
Inspect the selected toolkit's overall capabilities before adding machinery.
Run the named reproduction or inspect the artifact. If an issue is already
fixed, verify its current behavior and regression coverage rather than duplicate
it; add missing coverage when that is the remaining requirement.

Reuse a settled approach after checking it against current evidence. Research
primary sources when a decision depends on current external facts and reconcile
them with the installed version. For an unresolved material choice or requested
comparison, read [references/approach-selection.md](references/approach-selection.md).
It owns comparison evidence and the registered `grilling` loop. Explicit
`automatic` mode skips that interview while preserving investigation and the
user's ownership of material product, architecture, security or scope choices.
If required external evidence is unavailable, stop the dependent work; continue
independent investigation and any established in-scope correction. A
conclusively failed readiness threshold blocks dependent work the same way.

## Develop and verify

This loop covers development only: `/deliver` owns end-to-end delivery and
`/create-pr` owns publication. Reuse the confirmed requirements and approach.

1. Reuse or create a focused branch/worktree under `git-workflow`. Apply its
   clean-worktree and fresh-base gate before new work; preserve owned in-progress
   changes when resuming the same implementation.
2. Implement the smallest complete change, then run and inspect the real result.
   For UI/UX work, compare affected states with the requested appearance,
   interactions and fidelity; include relevant accessibility and viewports.
   Run focused developer checks while fixing observed gaps.
3. Apply `/code-review fix-all` and `/test-against-spec fix`. Review the actual
   change against the agreed requirements; test observable behavior against
   explicit specification sources. Use their direct documented equivalents if
   unavailable. Reuse matching evidence without repeating already-covered work.
4. Repair every verified requirement gap, including visual or behavioral fidelity,
   regardless of a finding's severity. Optional improvements outside the agreed
   outcome do not become requirements. Any edit invalidates affected evidence:
   repeat the necessary review, inspection and behavior checks until they agree
   on the unchanged result. Own the final applicable Definition of Done and
   project gate; run only its missing or invalidated checks.

Continue safe in-scope repair; reconsider an approach that is not advancing
acceptance. If required behavior needs an unavailable exact-revision preview,
return the specific publication need to the active delivery or PR caller, which
owns that operation and resumes testing afterward. A standalone implementation
asks only for the missing authority or environment.

## Finish

Finish when every verified requirement gap is resolved and applicable gates
pass; unrelated improvements do not extend the task. Return the implemented
result and observed requirement evidence to the caller. Report unresolved
required behavior as incomplete; never waive it because its finding is low
severity.
