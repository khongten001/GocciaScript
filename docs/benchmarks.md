# Benchmarks

*For contributors measuring performance or adding new benchmarks.*

## Executive Summary

- **Module-only benchmark API** — Import `bench`, `group`, `run`, `summary`, and `boxplot` from `"goccia:microbench"`; no benchmark helpers are ambient globals
- **Distribution-aware reports** — Five output formats report p75/p99/p999 and interquartile bars; scoped `boxplot()` and `summary()` wrappers add charts and uncertainty-aware comparisons, with reproducible statistics in structured output
- **Profiler-backed runs** — Bytecode benchmark runs can emit opcode/function profiles with `--profile`, including deterministic single-run capture
- **CI integration** — PR workflow posts benchmark comparison comments with range-overlap classification; main CI retains deterministic profile reports
- **Environment tuning** — Calibration time, warmup iterations, and measurement rounds configurable via environment variables
- **Cross-engine AWFY lane** — `scripts/awfy-driver.js` runs pinned AWFY and `perf/probes/` diagnostics under GocciaScript, QuickJS, and Node without mixing them into the benchmark-runner corpus
- **JetStream 3 reference lane** — `scripts/jetstream-driver.js` runs a frozen, shell-portable subset of the pinned JetStream 3 corpus under the same three engines while preserving upstream workload source
- **Performance Barometer** — Main-branch AWFY and JetStream reports feed the unified `/performance` dashboard with version-bounded history and visible failed-run gaps
- **Web Tooling Goccia lane** — `scripts/web-tooling-driver.js` runs every pinned V8 Web Tooling workload under GocciaScript only and publishes retained JSON artifacts

GocciaScript includes a benchmark runner for measuring execution performance. Benchmarks live in the `benchmarks/` directory and import the benchmark API from `"goccia:microbench"`.

## Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Build the GocciaBenchmarkRunner
./build.pas benchmarkrunner

# Run all benchmarks
./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks

# Run a specific benchmark
./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks/fibonacci.js

# Run a benchmark from stdin
printf 'import { bench, group } from "goccia:microbench"; group("stdin", () => { bench("sum", () => 1 + 1); });\n' | ./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner --source-type=module
printf 'import { bench, group } from "goccia:microbench"; group("stdin", () => { bench("sum", () => 1 + 1); });\n' | ./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner - --source-type=module --mode=bytecode

# Run benchmarks with 2 parallel workers (default: CPU count)
./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks --jobs=2

# Run bytecode benchmarks with VM profiler data
./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks --profile=all --profile-output=bench-profile.json --jobs=1

# Capture a deterministic opcode/allocation profile for CI-style diffing
./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks/numbers.js --profile-deterministic --profile-output=profile.json

# Export results in different formats
./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks --format=json --output=results.json
./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks --format=compact-json --output=compact-results.json
./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks --format=csv --output=results.csv
./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks --format=text
```

When no path is provided, `GocciaBenchmarkRunner` reads benchmark source from stdin. Use `-` explicitly when you want stdin alongside other CLI options and still make the input source obvious.

## Output Formats

The GocciaBenchmarkRunner supports five output formats via the `--format` option:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `console` (default) | Pretty-printed output with group headers, throughput, variance, p75/p99/p999, per-benchmark interquartile bars, scoped boxplots, relative summaries, and setup/teardown times |
| `text` | Compact one-line-per-benchmark output followed by any scoped boxplots and relative summaries |
| `csv` | Scalar throughput and sample statistics, wrapper-scope identifiers, and derived relative-comparison fields |
| `json` | Structured JSON with the common CLI envelope and per-benchmark throughput, sample statistics, wrapper scopes, and uncertainty-aware relative comparison data |
| `compact-json` | Same structured JSON shape, omitting `build`, `memory`, `stdout`, and `stderr` for smaller machine-readable output |

Use `--output=<file>` to write results to a file instead of stdout.

## Profiling Benchmark Runs

`GocciaBenchmarkRunner` accepts the same VM profiling options as `GocciaScriptLoader`:
`--profile=opcodes|functions|all`, `--profile-output=<path>`, and
`--profile-format=flamegraph`. Profiling forces bytecode mode and serial execution
because profiler state is per thread.

Use profiler-backed benchmark runs when a benchmark ratio is ambiguous and you need
to see the opcode mix, scalar fast-path hit rate, JS function self-time, or
allocation attribution:

```bash
./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks/numbers.js \
  --profile=all \
  --profile-output=tmp/numbers-profile.json \
  --format=json \
  --output=tmp/numbers-bench.json \
  --jobs=1
```

For deterministic CI signals, add `--profile-deterministic`. This skips warmup,
calibration, and repeated measurement rounds, then runs each registered benchmark
once through the same setup/measurement/teardown lifecycle used by normal
benchmark runs. If `--profile` is not provided, it defaults to `--profile=all`.
The benchmark report remains structurally valid, but throughput fields are
placeholders; use the profile JSON for deterministic comparisons.

```bash
./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks/numbers.js \
  --profile-deterministic \
  --profile-output=tmp/numbers-deterministic-profile.json \
  --format=compact-json \
  --output=tmp/numbers-deterministic-report.json
```

## Configuring Benchmark Parameters

Benchmark calibration and measurement parameters can be configured via environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `GOCCIA_BENCH_WARMUP` | 5 | Number of warmup iterations before calibration |
| `GOCCIA_BENCH_CALIBRATION_MS` | 200 | Target calibration time in milliseconds |
| `GOCCIA_BENCH_CALIBRATION_BATCH` | 5 | Initial batch size for calibration |
| `GOCCIA_BENCH_ROUNDS` | 7 | Number of measurement rounds (1–50; median of IQR-filtered data is reported) |

Example:

```bash
# Fast local run with shorter calibration and fewer rounds
GOCCIA_BENCH_CALIBRATION_MS=50 GOCCIA_BENCH_ROUNDS=3 ./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks

# Thorough serial run with longer calibration and more rounds
GOCCIA_BENCH_CALIBRATION_MS=500 GOCCIA_BENCH_ROUNDS=15 ./build/GocciaBenchmarkRunner benchmarks
```

## Writing Benchmarks

Import benchmark helpers from `"goccia:microbench"`:

```javascript
import { bench, group, summary, boxplot } from "goccia:microbench";

group("collections", () => {
  const setIteration = {
    *run() {
      const set = new Set(Array.from({ length: 50 }, (_, i) => i));
      try {
        yield () => {
          let sum = 0;
          set.forEach((v) => { sum = sum + v; });
        };
      } finally {
        set.clear();
      }
    },
  }.run;

  bench("Set iteration", setIteration);

  bench("simple computation", () => {
    const result = 1 + 2 + 3;
  });
});

summary(() => {
  boxplot(() => {
    group("numbers", () => {
      bench("addition", () => 1 + 1);
    });
  });
});
```

### API

The primary benchmark form is `bench(name, fn)`, where `fn` is called many times during measurement. Generator callbacks provide setup and teardown without including that setup cost in the measured body:

```javascript
import { bench, group } from "goccia:microbench";

group("collections", () => {
  const setIteration = {
    *run() {
      const set = new Set(Array.from({ length: 50 }, (_, i) => i));
      try {
        yield () => {
          let sum = 0;
          set.forEach((v) => { sum = sum + v; });
        };
      } finally {
        set.clear();
      }
    },
  }.run;

  bench("Set iteration", setIteration);

  bench("simple computation", () => {
    const result = 1 + 2 + 3;
  });
});
```

- Code before the generator's first `yield` is setup.
- The yielded function is the timed benchmark body.
- Cleanup that must run during generator close belongs in a `finally` block around the `yield`.
- Setup and teardown are independently timed and reported as `setupMs`, `teardownMs`, and the main `opsPerSec`/`meanMs` metrics.
- `summary(fn)` creates a comparison scope. Its measured benchmarks are ordered by median invocation time and compared with the fastest member. The central ratio uses medians; the displayed range divides the competitor's p25/p75 by the fastest member's p75/p25. A range crossing `1.0x` is reported as inconclusive.
- `boxplot(fn)` creates a visualization scope. Its measured benchmarks share an interquartile chart scale from the fastest observed sample through the slowest p99.
- Nested `summary()` and `boxplot()` wrappers retain both memberships. Benchmarks outside a wrapper still receive percentile statistics and an individual interquartile bar, but do not participate in that scoped view.
- Wrapper callbacks may be async; the wrapper waits for the returned promise before closing its reporting scope.
- `run(opts?)` executes the currently registered benchmarks from script code. `GocciaBenchmarkRunner` also auto-runs registered benchmarks after loading a file, but a script-callable `run()` consumes the pending registry so the runner does not measure the same benchmarks twice.

### Data flow

```text
setup before yield → yielded run function → warmup/calibrate → throughput rounds → bounded samples → close generator
        ↓                         ↓                         ↓                  ↓                 ↓
     setupMs                iterations          ops/sec, CV, range     percentiles       teardownMs
```

### Guidelines

- Use generator setup to create data structures that the yielded benchmark function operates on. This isolates allocation cost from the operation being measured.
- Put cleanup in a generator `finally` block when setup creates resources that should be explicitly released.
- When the benchmark IS the creation (e.g., measuring `Array.from` speed), use a plain benchmark function with no setup.
- The benchmark function can be `async` for benchmarking async/await operations.

## How the GocciaBenchmarkRunner Works

The `GocciaBenchmarkRunner` program:

1. Parses CLI inputs (`--format`, `--output`, and the benchmark path or stdin marker).
2. Scans the provided path for `.js` files.
3. For each file, creates a `TGocciaEngine`, attaches `TGocciaRuntimeCore`, applies the loader runtime profile, and installs the benchmark runtime extension.
4. Loads and executes the source so benchmark files import `"goccia:microbench"` and register groups and benchmarks.
5. Measures lex, parse, compile (bytecode mode), script execution, and benchmark execution phases separately with nanosecond precision via `TimingUtils.GetNanoseconds`.
6. `group()` calls execute immediately, registering nested `bench()` entries.
7. After the script finishes, the runner auto-runs any benchmarks that were registered but not already consumed by a script-callable `run()`:
   - **Setup:** Advances generator callbacks to their first `yield` (timed) when a benchmark uses generator-style setup.
   - **Warmup:** Configurable iterations to stabilize (default 5). The yielded function or plain benchmark function is called for each iteration.
   - **Calibrate:** Scales batch size until it runs for at least the target calibration time (default 200ms). Uses nanosecond-resolution timing via `TimingUtils` (`clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` on Unix/macOS, `QueryPerformanceCounter` on Windows).
   - **Measure:** Runs multiple measurement rounds (default 7). GC is disabled during measurement for identical behavior in both interpreter and bytecode modes. Between rounds, `CollectYoung` reclaims measurement garbage efficiently (pre-marks old objects, only traverses new allocations). After all rounds, IQR-based outlier filtering removes noise spikes before computing the coefficient of variation (CV%) and median values.
   - **Sample:** Individually times at most 10,000 calibrated invocations. This separate pass leaves historical ops/sec and variance semantics unchanged and cannot add more invocations than calibration selected.
   - **Teardown:** Closes generator callbacks after measurement (timed), running `finally` cleanup when present.
8. After each file completes, `GC.Collect` runs to reclaim memory between script executions.
9. Collects all results into a `TBenchmarkReporter`, which renders the chosen output format.
10. After rendering, checks for failures via `TBenchmarkReporter.HasFailures`. If any benchmark entry has a non-empty `Error` field or zero `OpsPerSec`/`MeanMs`, the process exits with code 1.

### Exit Codes

| Exit Code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0` | All benchmarks completed successfully with non-zero measurements |
| `1` | One or more benchmarks failed — either an error occurred (access violation, exception) or a benchmark produced zero ops/sec or zero mean ms |

The non-zero exit code ensures CI pipelines fail when benchmarks crash or produce empty results.

## Script API

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `bench(name, fn)` | Register a benchmark function. `fn` is called many times during measurement; generator callbacks use pre-yield setup, a yielded measured function, and `finally` cleanup on close. |
| `group(name, fn)` | Group benchmarks (like `describe` in tests). Executes `fn` immediately. |
| `run(opts?)` | Execute registered benchmarks from script code and return results. Calling `run()` prevents the runner's post-load auto-run from measuring the same registry again. |
| `summary(fn)` | Register a comparison scope that reports median relative speed, a conservative interquartile ratio range, and inconclusive overlap. |
| `boxplot(fn)` | Register a visualization scope whose benchmarks share an interquartile chart scale. |

Benchmark Summary
  Total benchmarks: 4
  Total duration: 7.21s
```

Durations are auto-formatted by `FormatDuration` from `TimingUtils`: values below 0.5μs display as `ns`, values below 0.5ms as `μs`, values up to 10s as `ms` with two decimal places, and larger values as `s`.

The `±X.XX%` column shows the coefficient of variation across measurement rounds. It is omitted when variance is zero (e.g., with a single measurement round).

When a benchmark has a `setup` or `teardown` function, a second line displays their durations (e.g., `setup: 0.0120ms  teardown: 0.0010ms`).

## CI Integration

Benchmarks run as part of the CI pipeline in both **interpreter mode** and
**bytecode mode**. CI uses `GOCCIA_BENCH_CALIBRATION_MS=100` and
`GOCCIA_BENCH_ROUNDS=7` for stable measurements with IQR outlier filtering. On
pushes to `main`, the ubuntu-latest x64 runner emits JSON and validates the
report shape. PR comparison builds and benchmarks `main` on the PR's own runner
rather than reading a cached baseline ([ADR 0076](adr/0076-same-runner-benchmark-comparison.md)).
See [testing.md](testing.md#ci-integration) for the full pipeline overview.

Main bytecode benchmark runs also retain deterministic VM profile reports. The
GitHub Actions artifact is named `benchmark-profile` and contains:

- `benchmark-profile-aggregate.json`: aggregate opcode, opcode-pair, scalar
  fast-path, function, allocation, and benchmark-file hotspot data.
- `benchmark-profile-aggregate.md`: a human-readable summary with the same
  provenance and ranked tables.
- `profile-baseline/`: the detailed per-benchmark-file profile JSON directory
  used by PR profile diffs and deeper investigation.

When `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is configured, main CI publishes the same payloads
to Vercel Blob under the separate `benchmark-profiles/` namespace. The default
paths are `benchmark-profiles/runs/<artifactId>/aggregate.json.gz`,
`benchmark-profiles/runs/<artifactId>/summary.md`,
`benchmark-profiles/runs/<artifactId>/details.tar.gz`, and
`benchmark-profiles/daily/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`.

### PR Benchmark Comparison

The PR workflow (`.github/workflows/pr.yml`) builds the PR's base commit (`main`) in a `build-main` job and benchmarks that `main` build and the PR build **back-to-back on the same runner** (after a discarded warm-up), so deltas reflect the diff rather than cross-runner variance (issue #815, [ADR 0076](adr/0076-same-runner-benchmark-comparison.md)). The comparison logic lives in [`scripts/benchmark-compare.js`](../scripts/benchmark-compare.js) (unit-tested by `scripts/test-benchmark-compare.ts`). It posts a collapsible comparison comment on the PR; each benchmark file gets a **unified table** with both execution modes side by side:

- Each table row shows `| Benchmark | Interpreted (main → PR) | Δ | Bytecode (main → PR) | Δ |` with the point estimate and same-runner `main`/PR min-max range in the form `10,000 ops/sec [9,500..10,500] → 9,200 ops/sec [8,700..9,700]`
- Classification uses **range overlap** instead of a single point value: if the PR run sits fully above the `main` range it is improved, if it sits fully below it is regressed, and overlapping ranges are treated as unchanged noise
- Percentage deltas remain in the `Δ` column as secondary context, even when the classifier marks a benchmark as `~ overlap`
- The overall summary reports the measured **median per-run variance** as a noise floor, so sub-noise deltas are read as unchanged
- Results are **grouped by file**, each in a collapsible `<details>` section
- Files with significant changes (improvements or regressions) are auto-expanded
- Each file summary shows per-mode counts (e.g., `Interp: 🟢 1, 7 unch. · Bytecode: 🟢 2, 6 unch.`)
- The **overall PR summary** shows per-mode totals on separate lines with average percentage deltas
- The comparison is **advisory** (comment-only, never merge-blocking)
- 🟢 marks non-overlapping improvements, 🔴 marks non-overlapping regressions, `~ overlap` marks overlapping ranges, and 🆕 marks new benchmarks absent from the `main` build

## AWFY Cross-Engine Lane

The `benchmarks/` directory is reserved for `GocciaBenchmarkRunner` inputs that
import `"goccia:microbench"` and register `group()` / `bench()` cases. Cross-engine AWFY and diagnostic
probes live under `perf/` because they are plain shell-portable scripts driven by
Node tooling, not benchmark-runner files. This keeps CI's recursive benchmark
scan from treating diagnostic probes as missing benchmark-runner inputs.

Use `scripts/awfy-driver.js` for #856/#862 investigation:

```bash
# List pinned AWFY benchmark names and Goccia-owned probes
node scripts/awfy-driver.js --list

# Run one AWFY benchmark from a local upstream checkout
node scripts/awfy-driver.js \
  --awfy-dir /path/to/are-we-fast-yet/benchmarks/JavaScript \
  --benchmark NBody \
  --inner-iterations 1 \
  --repetitions 5 \
  --engines goccia,qjs,node \
  --output tmp/awfy-report.json

# Run one diagnostic probe through the same normalized report schema
node scripts/awfy-driver.js \
  --probe generic-plus-scalars \
  --inner-iterations 1000 \
  --repetitions 1 \
  --engines goccia,qjs,node \
  --output tmp/probe-report.json
```

`perf/awfy/manifest.json` records the upstream AWFY repository, pinned commit,
JavaScript corpus path, driver version, and diagnostic probe catalog. The driver
generates per-benchmark portable AWFY bundles from the selected benchmark's
CommonJS dependency graph instead of using upstream `harness.js` directly. That
avoids Node-only globals (`require`, `process.argv`, `process.hrtime`,
`process.stdout`) and prevents one unrelated benchmark parse failure from
blocking every other benchmark.

### Updating the AWFY Pin

The AWFY corpus SHA is pinned in `perf/awfy/manifest.json`. A weekly workflow
(`.github/workflows/awfy-bump.yml`) fetches the latest
`smarr/are-we-fast-yet` `master` SHA, runs `bun scripts/awfy-bump-pin.ts`, and
opens an automated PR when the manifest changes. The workflow no-ops when the
pin is already current, matching the test262 and TOML suite bump pattern.

Manual bump:

```bash
bun scripts/awfy-bump-pin.ts <40-hex-sha>
```

The normalized report records:

- raw samples for every engine/target/repetition
- medians, IQR-filtered medians, min/max, coefficient of variation, and
  geomean pairwise ratios
- checksum/verification results and cross-engine checksum agreement
- timeout, crash, OOM, missing-result, and verification-failed outcomes
- Goccia commit, FPC version, platform, architecture, reference-engine versions,
  AWFY corpus SHA, and driver version

Pull requests run an AWFY report lane from `.github/workflows/pr.yml`.
The target set is recorded in `perf/awfy/manifest.json` under `ciReport`: all
pinned AWFY benchmarks under the production-built PR Goccia bytecode loader, the
production-built PR `main` baseline loader, QuickJS, and the latest Node Current
release resolved by `actions/setup-node` at workflow time, with five raw samples
per engine.
Sampling is interleaved as target -> repetition -> engine, so every repetition
runs the selected engines next to each other instead of collecting engine-sized
batches. The workflow uploads the normalized JSON report and posts an
`AWFY Results` PR comment with main/PR Goccia medians, the per-target PR-vs-main
delta, and reference-engine medians; min/max/CV and raw samples stay in the
`awfy-report` artifact. Diagnostic probes remain available through the same
driver for focused engine work, but they are not mixed into the PR AWFY summary.

AWFY rows with sub-0.5ms medians are useful for verifying that the benchmark
runs consistently, but they are timer-floor sensitive. Before using one of those
rows as evidence for a broad runtime claim, rerun that target with a higher
`--inner-iterations` value and inspect the artifact's min/max/CV.

Full CI runs the same AWFY report on the ubuntu-latest x64 build. It uploads the
`awfy-report` artifact on every full CI run. On `main`, when
`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is configured, the workflow also publishes the compressed
report JSON to Vercel Blob under the separate `awfy/` namespace. The default
paths are `awfy/runs/<artifactId>/report.json.gz` and
`awfy/daily/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`.

When comparing two Goccia binaries, pass `--goccia-baseline` and
`--goccia-candidate`; the driver interleaves baseline and candidate samples per
target and repetition. Runtime claims for #862 should use this interleaved
shape, not sequential baseline-then-candidate batches.

Profiler-backed runs stay separate from timing. For selected Goccia outliers or
diagnostic probes, add `--profile=opcodes|functions|all --profile-dir=<dir>` and
run a dedicated diagnostic pass; do not mix profiled timings into ratio claims.

### Issue Acceptance Criteria

Issue #856 is complete when AWFY JavaScript benchmarks run under GocciaScript
bytecode, QuickJS, and the latest Node Current release from the same driver;
reports retain raw samples and derived statistics; verification/checksum results
agree or fail explicitly; timeout, crash, and OOM are first-class outcomes;
metadata is sufficient to reproduce the run; and at least one Goccia AWFY outlier
can be rerun with opcode/function profiles attached.

Issue #862 should use `perf/probes/` as implementation gates for dispatch,
primitive lowering, call path, string/RegExp cliffs, typed-array call/return
boxing, and inline-cache shape behavior. AWFY and web-tooling remain
roadmap-level transfer proof. Allocation reductions are supporting evidence
only; they do not prove a runtime win without interleaved timing movement and
profile evidence for the mechanism.

## JetStream 3 Reference Lane

The JetStream lane supplements AWFY with a frozen set of modern, pure-JavaScript
workloads from [`WebKit/JetStream`](https://github.com/WebKit/JetStream). It is a
directional reference-engine barometer, not an attempt to reproduce the official
browser suite or rank runtimes with different goals.

```bash
# List the frozen workload set
node scripts/jetstream-driver.js --list

# Run one workload from the pinned upstream checkout
node scripts/jetstream-driver.js \
  --jetstream-dir /path/to/JetStream \
  --benchmark hash-map \
  --repetitions 1 \
  --engines goccia,qjs,node \
  --output tmp/jetstream-report.json

# Run the retained CI report contract
node scripts/jetstream-ci-report.js \
  --jetstream-dir /path/to/JetStream \
  --output tmp/jetstream-report.json
```

`perf/jetstream/manifest.json` pins JetStream 3.0 commit
`c603c04db8505477867974a69789309ded2cc948`, driver version, process
repetitions, and these six workloads: `hash-map`, `ai-astar`, `gaussian-blur`,
`raytrace-public-class-fields`, `sync-fs`, and `lazy-collections`. The selection
covers collections, control flow, numeric/array work, public class fields,
generators, and iterators without requiring Wasm, DOM, workers, a host filesystem,
or a second copy of the Web Tooling lane. The private-field raytrace variant is
excluded because it does not complete inside the diagnostic time budget.

### Updating the JetStream Pin

`.github/workflows/jetstream-bump.yml` checks WebKit/JetStream `main` weekly,
updates the manifest and current pin reference with
`scripts/jetstream-bump-pin.ts`, and opens an automated PR only when
the SHA changes. PR CI runs the complete frozen subset before merge.

The driver concatenates the listed upstream files unchanged into one generated
shell entry per workload. The generic adapter supplies timing, deterministic
randomness where the manifest requests it, and result serialization. Each suite
iteration uses JetStream's First/Worst/Average subscore formula; CI deliberately
uses three suite iterations and five process repetitions. Therefore the result is
a stable GocciaScript project measurement, not an official full-suite JetStream
score.

Reports retain raw scores, subscores, medians, IQR/min/max/CV, explicit upstream
validation availability and outcomes, failure stdout/stderr, corpus and driver
versions, per-binary Goccia source revisions/FPC, and QuickJS/Node versions.
Workloads without an upstream `validate()` hook are labeled `execution-only`; the
adapter does not invent a checksum or claim that validation passed. Timeouts,
crashes, OOMs, missing results, and verification failures remain structurally
valid report rows and fail the CI gate after the artifact and main-branch Blob
pointer have been written. CI runs one workload per parallel shard, preserving
repetition-to-engine interleaving inside each workload, then validates metadata
and recomputes geomean ratios in manifest order. Shards checkpoint after every
sample so an outer cancellation still leaves diagnostic report data.

The public Performance Barometer normalizes both external lanes so `1.00×` means
aligned performance and values above one mean GocciaScript was proportionally
slower. AWFY uses `Goccia time / reference time`; JetStream uses
`reference score / Goccia score`. QuickJS and Node.js stay separate reference
engines. Main publishes JetStream reports under the independent `jetstream/`
Blob namespace, and `/performance` combines their history with AWFY. Daily
pointers carry the normalized timeline summary, so the dashboard reads retained
history without downloading every full report; only the latest report is fetched
for the workload-detail tables. Trend lines break when corpus, subset, driver, or
reference-engine versions change. Failed runs remain visible as gaps; the most
recent complete point is labeled stale instead of being silently carried forward.

## Web Tooling Goccia Lane

The Web Tooling lane runs the pinned
[`v8/web-tooling-benchmark`](https://github.com/v8/web-tooling-benchmark)
corpus under GocciaScript only. Unlike AWFY, this is not a reference-engine
comparison lane: it is a real-world tooling viability probe for GocciaScript.
Node is used only as the upstream build tool for Webpack, not as a measured
engine.

Use `scripts/web-tooling-driver.js` for #857 investigation:

```bash
# List pinned Web Tooling workload names
node scripts/web-tooling-driver.js --list

# Run one workload from a local upstream checkout
node scripts/web-tooling-driver.js \
  --web-tooling-dir /path/to/web-tooling-benchmark \
  --workload acorn \
  --repetitions 1 \
  --output tmp/web-tooling-report.json

# Run the CI report set, which includes every pinned upstream workload
node scripts/web-tooling-ci-report.js \
  --web-tooling-dir /path/to/web-tooling-benchmark \
  --output tmp/web-tooling-report.json
```

`perf/web-tooling/manifest.json` records the upstream repository, pinned commit,
driver version, and the full workload list. The CI report set is intentionally
all pinned upstream workloads: `acorn`, `babel`, `babel-minify`, `babylon`,
`buble`, `chai`, `coffeescript`, `espree`, `esprima`, `jshint`, `lebab`,
`postcss`, `prepack`, `prettier`, `source-map`, `terser`, `typescript`, and
`uglify-js`.

### Updating the Web Tooling Pin

`.github/workflows/web-tooling-bump.yml` checks
`v8/web-tooling-benchmark` `master` weekly, updates the manifest with
`scripts/web-tooling-bump-pin.ts`, and opens an automated PR only when the SHA
changes. PR CI runs every pinned workload before merge.

The driver prepares upstream's generated Terser/UglifyJS self-bundles, then
generates one static entry and payload-only `fs.readFile`/`fs.readFileSync` adapter per
workload. Webpack therefore includes only the selected upstream benchmark
module, its tooling dependency, and the `third_party` files named by that
module. The generated entry times one direct call to the module's exported
`fn()`; process repetitions provide the raw samples, so Benchmark.js and its
Lodash-based measurement machinery are not part of the measured bundle.

Each bundle runs with `GocciaScriptLoader` in bytecode mode and the broad
ECMAScript compatibility flag set used for legacy tooling bundles. Every
workload has a five-minute process ceiling. A workload-specific override can be
pinned in the manifest only when a future corpus change has a documented reason
to exceed that shared budget.
PostCSS also runs with a 25 MB managed-heap ceiling so VM pressure collections
occur before the hosted runner's process-memory limit.
A workload build failure, timeout, crash,
OOM, or missing benchmark result is recorded as data in the JSON report; the CI
runner itself fails only when it cannot produce a complete report entry for
every manifest workload.

The normalized report records:

- raw Goccia samples for every workload/repetition
- median, IQR-filtered median, min/max, and coefficient of variation for
  reported `runs/s`
- first-class build-failed, timeout, crash, OOM, and missing-result outcomes
- Goccia commit, FPC version, platform, architecture, compatibility flags, Web
  Tooling corpus SHA, direct-invocation harness metadata, and driver version

Pull requests run the same all-workload report on the PR x64 build, with one
workload per CI matrix job and a final merge step. The workflow uploads the
normalized `web-tooling-report` JSON artifact and posts a
`Web Tooling Benchmark` PR comment with per-workload status and Goccia `runs/s`
where available. Full CI uploads the same artifact on every run. On `main`, when
`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is configured, the workflow also publishes the compressed
report JSON to Vercel Blob under the separate `web-tooling/` namespace. The
default paths are `web-tooling/runs/<artifactId>/report.json.gz` and
`web-tooling/daily/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`.
